# hkaAIC_Public
This repository contains MATLAB code to be used in conjunction with crystallographic image processing software CRISP. 
hkaAIC imports a set of *.hka files generated after origin refinment in CRISP. These files correspond to different 
plane-symmetry-enforced versions of a single image. 
The entire set of *.hka files should be selected at once in the "open file" dialog generated by the script by control-
clicking all files of interest and clicking "open."

hkaAIC calculates sums of squared residuals for both full complex Fourier coefficients as well as for Fourier coefficient
amplitudes. These can be used to calculate geometric Akaike Information Criterion values for plane symmetry groups and 
Laue classes, respectively.

At the end of the script, you will be asked if you would like to export the results as a .xls file (Microsoft Excel spreadsheet).
To do so, enter a file name, and click "save."
